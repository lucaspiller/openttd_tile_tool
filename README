====================================================
  
1) Introduction

This is a free tool (released under the GNU General Public License) to help out the graphics people by providing them with an interface to test out their new tiles.

For more information and a tutorial see the wiki page:
http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/Tile_Test_Tool

2) Running

Make sure you have the data/ directory, if not obtain it from a source package, or SVN, then run the executable - see the wiki page for more information.

3) Compiling

On Unix like systems (including Mac OS X) you should just be able to run the "make" command, and everything will work perfectly. If not double check the have the required dependancies, and file a bug report / fix.

On Windows:
- if under Cygwin, just use "make".
- Dev c++ use "tile.dev", which will automatically create a Makefile.
- Visual Studio / Visual C++ use "tile.sln" and "tile.vcproj" (Note: the paths to resource files may need changing)

Anything else, good luck!

4) Depedancies

SDL, SDL Image, a C++ compiler, and header files, something else.
